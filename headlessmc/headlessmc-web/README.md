# HeadlessMc-Web

Using [CheerpJ](https://cheerpj.com/),
a Java runtime written in web assembly,
it is now possible to run HeadlessMc inside the browser.
A demo has been deployed at https://3arthqu4ke.github.io/headlessmc/.
There are some restrictions,
a browser plugin to disable 
[CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)
is required and CheerpJ is missing some native functions,
as well as full asm support, so we cannot launch the game, yet.
But we are quite close already,
If we developed a small instrumentation server
that works around the asm issues and could proxy CORS this would be no problem.
We can already launch smaller jars, like the forge and fabric installers.

To run HeadlessMc inside the browser only minor modifications were needed.
HeadlessMc-Web is launched through the headlessmc-launcher-wrapper, which
calls a custom main function in the [CheerpJ-Plugin](plugin) for HeadlessMc.
This main function creates a JFrame and redirects output and input to it,
so that we have a console. 
It then proceeds to launch the HeadlessMc-Launcher normally.
